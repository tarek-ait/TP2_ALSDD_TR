Binary Search Tree (BST) Traversal Implementations

This project was developed as part of our practical work for the Algorithmic Module at L'ecole Nationale d'Informatique, supervised by Dr. Zeggour. Our team, comprised of myself and my colleague Rayan Derradji, implemented four types of BST traversals using pure C.

Traversal Types Implemented
BB_LR (Branch by Branch, Left to Right):

This traversal method processes each branch of the BST from left to right.
LL_LR (Leaf by Leaf, Left to Right):

In this traversal, the algorithm visits each leaf node of the BST from left to right.
BB_RL (Branch by Branch, Right to Left):

This variant processes each branch from right to left.
LL_RL (Leaf by Leaf, Right to Left):

Similarly, this traversal visits each leaf node from right to left.
Implementation Details
Language Used: Z (similar to algorithm format) for the program specification and C for the implementation.
Features: The implementation includes an animation of all four traversals without relying on external libraries, demonstrating the algorithms in action.
Performance: Our solution achieved the highest evaluation among all first-year submissions.
Files Included
Z Program File: Contains the algorithm specifications in the Z language.
C File: Contains the pure C implementation of the BST traversals.
Acknowledgments
We would like to thank Dr. Zeggour for his guidance and support throughout this project, which has significantly enhanced our understanding of algorithms and data structures.
